Introduction
  - start with motivation that triggers interest
  - do some literature review, provide reference if anybody did related work.
  - describe the problems and its importance
  - provide a summary of what the following section will discuss and how they touch the problem

Describe data
  - exact source of data (should give links or exact reference)
  - Is the data from multiple sources?
  - is it publicly available?
  - variables in the data
  - what was the primary aim of data collection
  - how this data is useful for your current analysis
  - how did you clean and prepare data

Include fact and figures
  - show tables of summary (when possible) with caption
  - show figures with caption
  - in the text, refer to those tables and figures
  - there should be a reason why the figures/tables are included. explain it in the sections.
  - graph/plot should be resized to fit into text properly, avoid using too big/small plot
  - the axis, table column, model variables should be labelled properly in the context of the data
  - font of text in the plot should be big enough to read and smaller than or equal to the main text font

About R codes
  - try to avoid including R codes
  - Include R codes in the report if absolutely necessary. We can always review your code in .Rnw file.
  - Don't expect that reader will understand what you did by reading your R codes
  - Describe in the texts what you did in R in such a way that other people can reproduce it in any language

The main sections should include information below followed by a well written abstract
  - Introduction
  - Data
  - Exploratory study and/or modeling setup
  - Results/findings and data products or models
  - Conclusion and future direction of the work

Finally 
  - the project should tell a complete story which is useful and interesting. 
  - can you tell that story in a sentence? Summarize that as a title of the project
  - overall the report should be nice, clean and professional looking
     - page or picture size should be set up properly
